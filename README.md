# Why should I pay a gas price?
The price of gas that a user offers should generally reflect how fast they want a transaction mined. Most users also want to avoid offering a price this is so low that it will never be mined (or require them to resend the transaction at a higher price). While offering a high gas price can speed up confirmation some, there is a limit to the acceleration. Offering a higher gas price than what is needed for acceptance by all top miners is unlikely to speed up the transaction time further under nomral circumstances.
